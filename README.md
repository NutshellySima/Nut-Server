$ ./make.sh
# Add cert.pem and key.pem under ./certificate
$ ./server.out
```

## Caution
1. You should make sure the CGI is **secured** or you should drop root privileges manually by modifying the server software or inside the CGI.
2. This server does not support uploading files because lack of parsing of `multipart/form-data`.
3. This server does not support long header+content requests in order to prevent malicious requests.
4. This server does not support `Connection: keep-alive` semantic.
